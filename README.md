police information Management system using blockchain method:
In general, criminal activity is increasing over the globe. Reports of several of these incidents are lacking. 
While the police do have an online platform for both sorts of reports, the majority of first information reports(FIRs) are written by hand.
The police-filled FIR will be accompanied by additions to the blockchain network, encryption, and IPFS storage.
The changes can be easily tracked before presenting the FIR to the court.
If the police Officer does not file the FIR because of pressure or claims not to have received the complaint, the timestamp and complaint itself would be admissible as proof because they were recorded on the blockchain network.
